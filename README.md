# Assignment: Development of a Diagnostic Test Probability Calculator
AD 315 Assignment

## Objective:
Design and implement an application that allows a user to input the prevalence of a disease, the sensitivity of a diagnostic test, and the specificity of the test. The application will then compute and display the probability of the disease given the test result.

## Background:
Medical diagnostics rely heavily on accurately interpreting test results. Bayes' Theorem provides a mathematical basis for updating probabilities based on test outcomes. Your application will assist medical professionals by providing immediate calculations of disease probability based on their input values.

## Assignment Details:
### Requirements:
- The application must have input fields for:
- Prevalence of the disease (Prior probability, P(Disease))
- Probability of testing positive given having the disease (Sensitivity, P(Test+|Disease+))
- Probability of testing negative given not having the disease (Specificity, P(Test-|Disease-))
- the application should display the probability of having the disease if tested positive and if tested negative.

### Evaluation:
Test the application with various input scenarios to ensure accuracy.
Discuss how the application might be used in a clinical setting and any limitations it might have.

### React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
